Description: Implements Bayesian brain mapping with population-derived priors, 
    including the original model described in Mejia et al. (2020) 
    <doi:10.1080/01621459.2019.1679638>, the model with spatial priors described
    in Mejia et al. (2022) <doi:10.1080/10618600.2022.2104289>, and the model 
    with population-derived priors on functional connectivity described in Mejia
    et al. (2025) <doi:10.1093/biostatistics/kxaf022>. Population-derived priors
    are based on templates representing established brain network maps, for 
    example derived from independent component analysis (ICA), parcellations, 
    or other methods.  Model estimation is based on expectation-maximization or 
    variational Bayes algorithms. Includes direct support for 'CIFTI', 'GIFTI', 
    and 'NIFTI' neuroimaging file formats.
